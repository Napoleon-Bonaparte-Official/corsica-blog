    "# Big Idea 5.6 Safe Computing\n",
    "![Banner](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/875326436/photo/cybersecurity-digital-globe-with-blueprint.jpg?s=1024x1024&w=is&k=20&c=6fcixWvWK7g-e91eI3JQJbGo82iCJnmUNC-Yl2z-dt0=)\n",

    "# What is Safe Computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Personal Identifiable Information (PII)\n",
    "Personal Identifiable Information or PII is a type of information that is **specific** to you. For example, your age or race would be an example but something like your favorite cat isn’t (Will insists your diet is a PII but it’s not). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are times when we want to post our PII online. For example, you would want to upload it to your job profile or a site like LinkedIn because you want people to see it. However, be careful where you upload this data. It will be known by everyone since it’s public.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Some things that you should be cautious about to upload (gray area) would be:\n",
    "- Birth date\n",
    "- Place of birth\n",
    "- Address\n",
    "- Phone number\n",
    "- Maiden names\n",
    "- Drivers License Number\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are things, however, that you will most likely have to upload publicly OR can be found with a quick search. For example:\n",
    "- Name\n",
    "- Date of Birth\n",
    "- SSN\n",
    "- Bank Account info\n",
    "- Email\n",
    "- Picture\n",
    "- What high school you attended\n",
    "- What college you went to\n",
    "- Properties you own\n",
    "- State/City of residence\n",
    "- Previous residence\n",
    "\n",
    "You could upload this online (some you have to. Ex: home address for Amazon) but be careful where you upload it. You don’t want to post your mother’s maiden name on social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Things that you should keep confidential would be: \n",
    "- Private credentials for accounts and what-not\n",
    "- Two-factor authentication\n",
    "- This is common for sensitive things like financial data\n",
    "- Social security numbers\n",
    "- Tax records\n",
    "- Medical information\n",
    "- Financial data\n",
    "\n",
    "Most if not all financial and government documents should be kept private. However, there will be times when you need to share this. For example, if you are applying for a RealID (form of identification), you will need to submit your social security number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### POPCORN HACK 1: \n",
    "> How do you decide what personal information to share online and what to keep confidential?\n",
    "\n",

    "## PII considerations\n",
    "<!-- stuff -->\n",
    "\n",
    "## Beware, Establish practices for your own Safety\n",
    "#### Authentication\n",
    "> Authentication measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access.\n",
    "#### Strong Passwords\n",
    "> The easier the password is to guess, the easier it is to make a mess.\n",
    "Strong passwords:\n",
    "- 10 or more characters \n",
    "- Must contain a symbol\n",
    "- Must contain a number\n",
    "- Must contain lowercase and uppercase letters\n",
    "- Avoid dictionary words/things known about you (ex. “Password”, “123456”, your birthday, your name, your pet’s name, etc.)\n",
    "> The above are things hackers can look for while guessing your password\n",
    "#### Types of Authentication\n",
    "- What the user knows (ex. passwords, answers to security questions, etc.)\n",
    "- What you are (ex. biometric data like eye scan, palm print, thumbprint, etc.)\n",
    "- What you have (ex. keycards, etc.)\n",
    "#### Multi-factor Authentication\n",
    "> When one or more of these authentication measures are used, it is considered multi-factor authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Precautions\n",
    "- Run Virus scans to help prevent malicious code from getting into and affecting your system. \n",
    "- Keeping the operating system and other software up to date can also fix errors that would allow a virus or malware to compromise a system. \n",
    "\n",
    "### POPCORN HACK 2: \n",
    "> How can multi-factor authentication enhance security?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factors to Increase Security of System\n",
    "> Encryption is a good way to increase security of a system.\n",
    "### Symmetric Encryption - Basic ciphers or codes\n",
    "- Symmetric encryption is two ways. You can encrypt it and easily decrypt it with the same methods.\n",
    "    - Examples: Caesar cipher, morse code, rail fence cipher, pre shared key etc.\n",
    "- Asymmetric encryption is much safer and can be thought of as a one way gate where the encryption method does not work to  decrypt. You would need a separate key to decrypt asymmetric encryption.\n",
    "    - Examples: RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Public Key Encryption\n",
    "- Firewalls and antivirus\n",
    "    - Firewall and antivirus software is a really good and easy way to protect your computer. Pretty much all computers come with this software and are enabled as a default. Just make sure to not disable it!\n",
    "\n",
    "### POPCORN HACK 3: \n",
    "> What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nefarious Uses of Internet\n",
    "### Virus and Malware\n",
    "#### Virus\n",
    "- Viruses can allow unauthorized access by modifying the operating system to accept any user without authentication. \n",
    "- Virus malicious programs that can copy themselves and gain access to systems that they are not supposed to be in. \n",
    "#### Malware\n",
    "- Malware is often intended to damage a computing system or take partial control over its operation.\n",
    "- Infiltrates a system by posing as legitimate programs or by attaching itself to legitimate programs, like an email attachment.\n",
    "- Malware is often sent in attachments to things in email. Often they request you to click on an attachment and it starts the process of adding a virus to your computer.\n",
    "> Phishing: Phishing is an attempt to trick a user into providing personal information (PII) by using social manipulation.\n",
    "Phishing emails look like they’re from a trusted source. They may appear to be an email from a bank or credit card company or a store. They could also be from a Nigerian prince or a fish who is phishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "They try to trick you into clicking a link and may try to scare you or lure you with the promise of something like money. The link could cause unexpected harm. They may install a virus or keylogger on your computer.\n",
    "A keylogger records keystrokes made by the user which can be used to get credentials.\n",
    "They could also turn your computer into a rogue access point or a fake wireless network which can be used to infect other computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> So Now What?\n",
    "After being infected with a virus, your computer is compromised. If this happens, you’ll want to make sure you review all of your PII vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### POPCORN HACK 4: \n",
    "> What steps do you take to protect yourself from phishing attempts and potential virus infections (other than the ones mentioned)?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework\n",
    "1. Describe PII you have seen on a project in CompSci Principles.\n",
    "2. What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?\n",
    "3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication?\n",
    "4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.\n",
    "5. Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.\n",
    "6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way(If you really can’t think of one, maybe talk about someone you know!). Describe some other phishing techniques.\n",
