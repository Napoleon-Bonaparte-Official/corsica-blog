    "## Deployment Overview\n",
    "Deploying a Web Application enables a Server and Web Application to be available to users on the Internet. Development Operations (DevOps) is understanding the tools and service used to enable the Web Application on the Internet.  This process can use many different cloud services, as well as choice of many different tools.  Here is an overview of what is covered in this procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- EC2: Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform that the PUSD district has provided for their students to serve our Web Application.\n",
    "- GitHub: The leading open platform to share a code across the Internet.\n",
    "- Docker and docker-compose: Used to host a Web Application.  A Docker container prepares an environment that contains the Web Application code and all the dependencies (requirements.txt for Python)  Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.\n",
    "- Nginx: In order to find a Web Application on a server, there needs to be a process that listens for the Web Application request and directs it to the Web Application service.  Nginx is an open source software for web serving, reverse proxy, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more.\n",
    "- Certbot: Web traffic on internet is reliably served over Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (https).  Certbot is a free, open source software tool for automatically using Let's Encrypt certifications.\n",
    "- DNS: Natively, the web works off of IP addresses.  Domain Name Services (DNS) allows the assignment of a friendly name to a Web Server.  This name is built into Nginx/Certbot configuration files.  Freenom is the cloud service described in this blog and has been used to register the nighthawkcodingsociety.com domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key/Values required as you go through these procedures\n",
    "Listed are Keys, you need to obtain \"values\" specific to your Web Application setup.  It is important that you recognize the sample \"values\" as you work through these procedures, then replace them with the \"values\" that are specific to your Web Application use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GitHub HTTPS link:\n",
    "- IAM user: \n",

    "## Server Setup and Initial Deployment\n",
    "> Development Operations (DevOps) begins with server setup.    \n",
    "### Amazon Web Services (AWS): Electric Cloud Compute (EC2) Setup\n",
    "Preparing and AWS EC2 instance is the process of creating a cloud computer.  This process starts by logging into your AWS IAM user, searching for EC2.\n",
    "- To get started, launch a new AWS EC2 instance to learn process and understand how to work with Linux. here are some key considerations.\n",
    "    - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the class will be using Ubuntu you should check on last verified version with a Teacher before proceeding\n",
    "    - When it comes to picking memory or disk it is VERY important to pick Free Tier.  As stated, this will only be used for testing and then it will be disposed for cost efficiency.\n",
    "    - When presented with access dialog for http and https, make sure you check these boxes.  Remember you are making a Web application that will run over http and https.\n",
    "    - Name the security group (.pem) file after your self or team.  It may be necessary to use SSH to access your EC2 instance.\n",
    "    - The remainder of the steps you can use the defaults, refer to AWS documentation for guidance: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html\n",
    "    - At the end of this process you need to \"Connect to Instance\". This will provide you a terminal like experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deployment Process \n",
    "> Deployment begins with terminal connections.   It is necessary to run commands to setup files to enable your Web Application to run on the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connect to EC2 through cloud\n",
    "> Connect to an Ubuntu EC2 instance on AWS and then begin the system and software setup.\n",
    "- Select your machine and press \"Connect\" at top middle.\n",
    "![AWS Connect]({{site.baseurl}}/images/aws_connect.png)\n",
    "- On next screen ensure things are lined \"EC2 Instance Connect\" and press \"Connect\" at bottom.\n",
    "![AWS2 Connect]({{site.baseurl}}/images/aws_connect2.png)\n",
    "- Only if this fails you will need to connect from our Anaconda terminal, we need pem file so place it in your home directory.\n",
    "![AWS SSH]({{site.baseurl}}/images/aws_ssh.png)\n",
    "- Either connection should work at home, school WIFI may be blocking, I have been trying to get this open.  A Hot spot or [VPN]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorial/vpn) will solve connection errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update, Upgrade, and Install packages\n",
    "Terminal commands are shown, these commands will be run from Terminal after you connect to your EC2 instance.  It is advised that you try to comprehend and learn these commands as you go through these procedures.  Understanding steps is how you become a DevOps Engineer.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
